# Start a Changelog JS

An npx-able way to get a copy of the changelog from https://keepachangelog.com .
It's especially helpful when starting up a new project and you don't want to
leave your CLI.

## Installation

You _could_ install it, but you'll probably just want to:

```
$ npx start-a-changelog > CHANGELOG.md
```

To install (note this package has _no_ dependencies other than node/npm)

```
$ npm i -g start-a-changelog
```

## Benefits

1. starting a detailed changelog is _very nice_ for your users
2. You can `npx` it or install it globally (it has no dependencies)

## Credit
